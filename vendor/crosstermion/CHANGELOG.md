## 0.13.0 (2023-12-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7b49dd81a3f7c209279e90c1110de00dfd6a0701/> upgrade to `ratatui` v0.25
 - <csr-id-2df671a3b4e33e3c960c91e6c10f9e8fe6c94a11/> Remove support for termion; use `crossterm` events directly.
   Also remove custom Key/Event abstractions and use the ones provided
   by `crossterm` instead. This is very much a breaking change,
   but requires only mechanical adjustments.

## v0.7.0

* upgrade to TUI 0.15

## v0.4.0

* upgrade to TUI 0.12

## v0.3.2

* Remove `futures-util` dependency in favor of `futures-lite`

## v0.2.0

* remove native support for `flume` and `crossbeam-channel` for key input in favor of `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver`s :).

## v0.1.5

* support for simple cursor movements
* get terminal size
* color support to learn if color is allowed, and dynamically disable it
  if `ansi_term` is used.

## v0.1.4

* Fix precendence of imports in 'terminal' module.

## v0.1.3

* `Key` type conversions are now always compiled when possible, as they are not mutually exclusive

## v0.1.2

* Enable `flume/select` by default and allow selecting `flume/async` via the `flume-async` feature.

## v0.1.1

* Add support for 'input-thread-flume' for using flume channels instead of crossbeam ones. They are
  smaller and there is no unsafe code either, at the expense of lack of the 'select!()` capability.

## v0.1.0

Initial release.
