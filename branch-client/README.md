# branch-client

Command line utility to manage Git branches using `gix`.

## Features

- List local or remote branches
- Create new branches from any revision
- Delete branches
- Compare two branches and show how many commits they are ahead or behind
- Cleanup merged branches (local only)

This is an early proof of concept and does not push to remotes yet.
